# ML Internship - Task 1 - Image Recognition (Face Recognition)

Algorithm: Haar Cascade Frontal Face Algorithm (For Face Detection)

First you need to create the dataset:
    Method 1: Creating a dataset by capturing images using your web camera 
        For this method, Run data_creation_using_webcam python file

    Method 2: Creating a dataset by downloading images from Google
        For this method, Run data_creation_using_webcam python file

        Downloaded files will be saved into images folder.
        Then faces are detected from each image and the faces are saved in the dataset folder.

After create the dataset, You can move to the Face Recognition:
    Run face_recognize.py file
